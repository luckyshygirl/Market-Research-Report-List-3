<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acute Care Needleless Connector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Fluid Displacement</li><li>Negative Fluid Displacement</li><li>Neutral Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acute care needleless connectors have three main types: Positive Fluid Displacement, Negative Fluid Displacement, and Neutral Displacement. Positive Fluid Displacement connectors use a spring mechanism to push fluid out, reducing the risk of blood reflux. Negative Fluid Displacement connectors have a mechanical valve that prevents backflow when adding or removing syringes. Neutral Displacement connectors maintain a neutral pressure within the system, reducing the risk of air embolisms. Each type offers different benefits for preventing infections and improving patient safety in acute care settings.</p></p>
