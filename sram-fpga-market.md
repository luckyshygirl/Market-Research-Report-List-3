<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SRAM FPGA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Less Than 28 nm</li><li>28-90 nm</li><li>More Than 90 nm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SRAM FPGAs can be classified into three market types based on their manufacturing process node - Less Than 28 nm, 28-90 nm, and More Than 90 nm. FPGAs with Less Than 28 nm nodes offer higher performance and efficiency due to smaller transistor sizes. FPGAs in the 28-90 nm range strike a balance between performance and cost. On the other hand, FPGAs with More Than 90 nm nodes are more cost-effective but may not have the same level of performance as the smaller nodes.</p></p>
