<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based Polyester Coating</li><li>Solvent-Based Polyester Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyester coatings come in two main types: water-based polyester coatings and solvent-based polyester coatings. Water-based polyester coatings are environmentally friendly, as they contain fewer volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than solvent-based coatings. They are commonly used for indoor applications due to their low odor and easy cleanup with water. On the other hand, solvent-based polyester coatings are more durable and provide a high level of protection against abrasion and chemicals, making them ideal for outdoor applications that require enhanced durability and resistance.</p></p>
