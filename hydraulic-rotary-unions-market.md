<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Rotary Unions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Passage</li><li>Single-Passage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydraulic rotary unions come in two main types: Multi-Passage and Single-Passage. Multi-Passage rotary unions are designed to transfer multiple fluids or media simultaneously, allowing for more complex and efficient systems. These unions have multiple channels or passages that can rotate independently. On the other hand, Single-Passage rotary unions are simpler in design and only transfer one media at a time. They are commonly used in applications where only one fluid or media needs to be transferred. Both types play a crucial role in facilitating fluid power transmission in various industries.</p></p>
