<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plants Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas plants are constructed using two main market types: wet digestion and dry digestion. Wet digestion involves the fermentation of organic waste in the presence of water, resulting in the production of biogas. This process is commonly used for liquid waste, such as sewage sludge or food waste. Dry digestion, on the other hand, does not require water and involves the decomposition of organic waste in a dry environment, producing biogas as well. Dry digestion is typically used for solid waste materials like agricultural residues or energy crops. Both methods contribute to sustainable energy production through the utilization of organic waste.</p></p>
