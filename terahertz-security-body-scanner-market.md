<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terahertz Security Body Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Terahertz security body scanners are classified into two types based on their operating principles - active type and passive type. Active type scanners emit terahertz waves and analyze the reflected signals to create an image of the scanned body. On the other hand, passive type scanners detect the natural terahertz waves emitted by the body and create an image without emitting any radiation. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various security applications to detect concealed objects or substances on individuals.</p></p>
