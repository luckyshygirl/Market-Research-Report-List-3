<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Propulsion Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Breathing</li><li>Non-Air Breathing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aviation propulsion systems can be classified into two main types: air-breathing and non-air breathing. Air-breathing systems, such as turbojet and turbofan engines, rely on atmospheric oxygen to combust fuel and produce thrust. Non-air breathing systems, such as rocket engines, carry their own oxidizer and do not require atmospheric oxygen. Both types have specific advantages and disadvantages based on factors like efficiency, speed, altitude capabilities, and payload capacity, catering to different aviation needs.</p></p>
