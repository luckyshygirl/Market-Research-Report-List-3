<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Feed Additives for Mycotoxin Detoxification Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adsorbing Agent</li><li>Bio-Transforming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Feed additives for mycotoxin detoxification are classified into two main types: adsorbing agents and bio-transforming agents. Adsorbing agents work by binding to mycotoxins in the digestive tract, preventing them from being absorbed into the bloodstream. Bio-transforming agents, on the other hand, help to break down mycotoxins into less harmful substances. Both types of additives play a crucial role in preventing mycotoxin-related illnesses in livestock and ensuring the safety of animal feed.</p></p>
