<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Retardant Cable Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intumescent Fire Retardant Cable Coatings</li><li>Non-Intumescent Fire Retardant Cable Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire retardant cable coatings are used to protect cables from catching fire during a fire outbreak. Intumescent fire retardant cable coatings expand when exposed to heat, forming a protective char layer that insulates the cable. Non-intumescent fire retardant cable coatings, on the other hand, do not expand but form a protective layer when exposed to fire. Both types of coatings are important for ensuring the safety of cables in buildings and structures.</p></p>
