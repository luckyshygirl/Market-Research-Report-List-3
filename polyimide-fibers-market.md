<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyimide fibers can be produced through two main processes: wet spinning and dry spinning. In wet spinning, a solution of polyimide is extruded into a coagulation bath to form the fibers. This method allows for greater control over the fiber properties and structure. In dry spinning, the polyimide solution is extruded into a hot air chamber, where the solvent evaporates and solidifies the fibers. This process is faster and more cost-effective, but may result in lower quality fibers compared to wet spinning.</p></p>
