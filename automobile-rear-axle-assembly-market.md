<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Rear Axle Assembly Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full-Floating Type</li><li>Semi-Floating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automobile rear axle assembly market consists of two main types: Full-Floating Type and Semi-Floating Type. Full-Floating Type axle design supports the weight of the vehicle on the axle housing, separate from the axle shafts. This provides superior load-carrying capacity and resistance to bending. On the other hand, the Semi-Floating Type axle design supports the weight of the vehicle on the axle shafts themselves. This design is lighter and more cost-effective but has lower load-carrying capacity compared to the Full-Floating Type.</p></p>
