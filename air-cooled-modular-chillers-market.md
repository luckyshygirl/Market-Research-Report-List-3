<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air-Cooled Modular Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-cooling Type</li><li>Heat Pump Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-cooling type air-cooled modular chillers are designed to provide cooling only. They are specifically built to regulate the temperature of a given space by removing the heat from the air. On the other hand, heat pump type air-cooled modular chillers serve a dual purpose of both cooling and heating. These chillers extract heat from the ambient air to cool a space in warm weather and can reverse the process in colder weather to provide heat. These two market types cater to different needs and preferences in temperature control systems.</p></p>
