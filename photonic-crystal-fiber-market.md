<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photonic-crystal Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Index-Guiding Fibers</li><li>Photonic Bandgap (Air Guiding) Fibers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photonic-crystal fiber market types include index-guiding fibers and photonic bandgap (air guiding) fibers. Index-guiding fibers rely on the refractive index difference between the core and cladding materials to guide light, while photonic bandgap fibers use a periodic pattern of air holes in the cladding to create photonic bandgaps that prevent certain wavelengths of light from propagating. Both types of fibers offer unique advantages and applications in telecommunications, sensing, and other fields that rely on efficient light guidance and control.</p></p>
