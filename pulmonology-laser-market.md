<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pulmonology Laser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>YAG Laser</li><li>Photodynamic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pulmonology Laser Market consists of two main types - YAG Laser and Photodynamic Laser. YAG Laser, focused on treating lung tumors and airway obstructions, utilizes a high-energy laser beam to precisely target and destroy abnormal tissue. Photodynamic Laser, on the other hand, involves a light-activated drug that is injected into the bloodstream and accumulates in cancer cells, which are then destroyed when exposed to specific light wavelengths. Both types offer minimally invasive treatments for pulmonary conditions, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p></p>
