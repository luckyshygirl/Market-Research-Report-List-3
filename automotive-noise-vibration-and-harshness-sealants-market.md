<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Noise, Vibration, and Harshness Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bonded</li><li>Non-bonded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Noise, Vibration, and Harshness Sealants are used in both bonded and non-bonded applications in the market. Bonded sealants are chemically designed to adhere to substrates, providing a strong bond that reduces noise, vibration, and harshness in vehicles. Non-bonded sealants, on the other hand, are used as standalone barriers to reduce noise, vibration, and harshness without directly adhering to the substrate. Both types of sealants play a crucial role in enhancing the overall driving experience by minimizing unwanted sounds and vibrations in vehicles.</p></p>
