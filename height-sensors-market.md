<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Height Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Height sensors can be classified into two main types: contact type and non-contact type. Contact type height sensors physically come into contact with the object being measured, providing accurate results but may cause wear and tear on the sensor and the object. Non-contact type height sensors do not physically touch the object, using technologies such as ultrasonic, laser, or capacitive sensors to measure height without causing damage. Non-contact type sensors are often preferred for delicate or fragile objects.</p></p>
