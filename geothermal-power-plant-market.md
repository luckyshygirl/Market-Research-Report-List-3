<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power plants utilize the Earth's heat to generate electricity. Dry steam stations use high-pressure steam extracted directly from underground reservoirs to power turbines. Flash steam power stations use hot water from reservoirs, which is converted into steam as it is released into lower-pressure tanks and then used to drive turbines. Binary cycle stations employ a heat exchanger to transfer the thermal energy from the geothermal fluid into a working fluid, which is vaporized and used to drive turbines. These distinct types drive the geothermal power plant market.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Plant Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Power Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Power Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal power plant market encompasses three main types: dry steam power stations, flash steam power stations, and binary cycle power stations. Dry steam power stations utilize the steam directly from underground to spin the turbine and generate electricity. Flash steam power stations, on the other hand, use high-pressure hot water to produce steam and drive the turbine. Binary cycle power stations employ a working fluid with a lower boiling point than water to transfer heat from geothermal sources to a fluid with a higher boiling point, thus generating electricity.</p></p>
