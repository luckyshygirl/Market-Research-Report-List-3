<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biocoal (Synthetic Coal) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biocoal, also known as synthetic coal, is produced through various methods such as torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to create a more energy-dense and stable form of coal. On the other hand, steam explosion uses high-pressure steam to break down biomass and produce a coal-like material. Both torrefaction and steam explosion processes are gaining popularity in the market as sustainable alternatives to traditional coal production methods.</p></p>
